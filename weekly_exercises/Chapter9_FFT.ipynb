Each nucleus gives out a signal at a characteristic frequency. If a molecule contains more than one hydrogen atom, the observed signal will have more than one frequency component. The Fourier transform of the signal therefore gives a spectrum which helps identify the molecules making up the wine. This technique of identifying the chemical composition of a liquid is known as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n",
