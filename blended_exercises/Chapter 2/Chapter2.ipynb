    "- An experiment results in a set of outcomes, which we will call $\\Omega$. This can be a discrete set of outcomes, such is in the classic coin toss, $\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}$, or the roll of a die, $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. However in many real life experiments, $\\Omega$, which is referred to as the *outcome space*, or *event space*, can have an infinite continuum of values. We will return to this idea later, but for the moment we will consider just discrete events to help outline the basic properties of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returning to the coin toss, we can say that a fair coin will have a probability of heads of $P(H) = 0.5$, and a probability of tails of $P(T) = 0.5$.  Each outcome of the experiment of tossing the coin,  $\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}$, are thus equally likely. Similarly, for a die roll, $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, with $p(i) = 1/6$. When an experiment has $m$ equally likely outcomes, the probability of any outcome $x$ is then:\n",
