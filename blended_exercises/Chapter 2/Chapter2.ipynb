One way you could test this is to perform lots of experiments (coin flips) and keep track of the outcome. If you do enough of these, eventually you will get an empirical measure,\n",

Well, that depends on how accurately you want to know $P(H)$. But for now, we will simply note that this type of determination of $P$ is *frequentist*, in that the probability is defined by counting the instances of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what about the probability that it will rain tomorrow? You can see straight away that such a probability is more difficult to define. In fact, the use of Bayes Theorem, and in particular the prior, introduces a much more vague idea that $P$ represents the belief that something will occur."
