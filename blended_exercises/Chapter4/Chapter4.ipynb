    "Testing a hypothesis is one of the foundations of data analysis. Examples include: does this drug make people better? Is the die fair? Are an observed population of low-mass galaxies consistent with the predictions from $\\Lambda$CDM? Did CERN really detect the Higg's Boson? We'll start this section by outlining the formal ideas behind hypothesis testing, and then look at some classic examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common form of hypothesis testing is  involves trying to find the unknown parameter $\\theta$ that is part of a model $f(\\theta)$. Now you might have a best guess for the unknown parameter, and an associated uncertainty, so really we're not always testing if $\\theta$ is an exact value, but more generally whether $\\theta \\in \\Theta$, that is $\\theta$ is part of some set of possible values $\\Theta$. From our best guess of $\\theta$, what we're trying to determine is whether $\\theta \\in \\Theta_0$ or $\\theta \\in \\Theta_1$, and where,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Theta_0 \\cup \\Theta_1 = \\Theta$ and $\\Theta_0 \\cap \\Theta_1 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then make a set of new observations of some outcome of the model $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots\\}$, and we want to test whether they support the idea that, say, $\\theta \\in \\Theta_1$. We also know the probability of the model predicting the data, which is given by $p(X, \\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **Null Hypothesis Significance Testing**, which we will abbreviate as NHST.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "H_0 &:&~\\theta \\in \\Theta_0 &~~ \\text{the null hypothesis} \\\\\n",
    "H_1 &:&~\\theta \\in \\Theta_1 &~~ \\text{the alternative hypothesis}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis assumes that nothing interesting happens/happened. The alternative hypothesis is where the action is i.e. some observation/ phenomenon is real (i.e. not a fluke) and statistical analysis will give us more insights on that.  The null hypothesis is saying that one variable does not affect the other and anything we see in our results are due to chance and are not significant in terms of supporting the idea being investigated. Thus, the null hypothesis assumes that whatever you are trying to prove did not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compute a statistic and then ask \"What is the chance of observing the test-statistic for this sample (considering its size and the probability governing the system), purely randomly (ie if the null hypothesis were true)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This chance — the probability value of observing the test-statistic — is the so-called $p-$value. The $p-$value is the probability of getting a value of the test statistic at least as extreme as that\n",
    "actually observed value purely by chance, if the null hypothesis is true.\n",

In contrast, a confidence interval (CI) contains a parameter (like a population mean) with a certain confidence level. In other words, the CI provides a range of possible plausible values for the target population, as well as the probability with which this range covers the real value.\n",

    "For example, your mean battery life might be 105 hours, and the 95% confidence interval in that number ranges from 100 to 110 hours. That means if you repeat your experiment millions of times, 95% of the time you repeat your experiment, the average battery life will fall into that range and the other 5% it will not.

Wilke's Fundamentals of Data Visualisation book [here](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-uncertainty.html)) for an illustration of this for a confidence interval of 68% (ie for this variable, the confidence interval includes the true mean approximately 68% of the time - green and does not contain the true mean 32% of the time -orange).\n",
