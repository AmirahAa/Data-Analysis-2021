Are an observed population of low-mass galaxies consistent with the predictions from $\\Lambda$CDM? Did CERN really detect the Higg's Boson? We'll start this section by outlining the formal ideas behind hypothesis testing, and then look at some classic examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common form of hypothesis testing is  involves trying to find the unknown parameter $\\theta$ that is part of a model $f(\\theta)$. Now you might have a best guess for the unknown parameter, and an associated uncertainty, so really we're not always testing if $\\theta$ is an exact value, but more generally whether $\\theta \\in \\Theta$, that is $\\theta$ is part of some set of possible values $\\Theta$. From our best guess of $\\theta$, what we're trying to determine is whether $\\theta \\in \\Theta_0$ or $\\theta \\in \\Theta_1$, and where,\n",

    "The null hypothesis assumes that nothing interesting happens/happened. The alternative hypothesis is, where the action is i.e. some observation/ phenomenon is real (i.e. not a fluke) and statistical analysis will give us more insights on that.  The null hypothesis is saying that one variable does not affect the other and anything we see in our results are due to chance and are not significant in terms of supporting the idea being investigated. Thus, the null hypothesis assumes that whatever you are trying to prove did not happen.\n",
    "\n",

Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",

We often choose a value of $\\alpha=0.05$ but it can be determined by the individual or team.   When a p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis. As an example, if a test gives the p-value, $p = 0.03$, the null hypothesis would be rejected at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, but not at the more conservative significance level $\\alpha = 0.01$.\n",
