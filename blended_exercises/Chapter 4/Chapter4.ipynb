   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Testing a hypothesis is one of the foundations of data analysis. Examples include: does this drug make people better? Is the die fair? Are an observed population of low-mass galaxies consistent with the predictions from $\\Lambda$CDM? Did CERN really detect the Higg's Boson? We'll start this section by outlining the formal ideas behind hypothesis testing, and then look at some classic examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common form of hypothesis testing is  involves trying to find the unknown parameter $\\theta$ that is part of a model $f(\\theta)$. Now you might have a best guess for the unknown parameter, and an associated uncertainty, so really we're not always testing if $\\theta$ is an exact value, but more generally whether $\\theta \\in \\Theta$, that is $\\theta$ is part of some set of possible values $\\Theta$. From our best guess of $\\theta$, what we're trying to determine is whether $\\theta \\in \\Theta_0$ or $\\theta \\in \\Theta_1$, and where,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Theta_0 \\cup \\Theta_1 = \\Theta$ and $\\Theta_0 \\cap \\Theta_1 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then make a set of new observations of some outcome of the model $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots\\}$, and we want to test whether they support the idea that, say, $\\theta \\in \\Theta_1$. We also know the probability of the model predicting the data, which is given by $p(X, \\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **Null Hypothesis Significance Testing**, which we will abbreviate as NHST.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "H_0 &:&~\\theta \\in \\Theta_0 &~~ \\text{the null hypothesis} \\\\\n",
    "H_1 &:&~\\theta \\in \\Theta_1 &~~ \\text{the alternative hypothesis}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis assumes that nothing interesting happens/happened. The alternative hypothesis is, where the action is i.e. some observation/ phenomenon is real (i.e. not a fluke) and statistical analysis will give us more insights on that.  The null hypothesis is saying that one variable does not affect the other and anything we see in our results are due to chance and are not significant in terms of supporting the idea being investigated. Thus, the null hypothesis assumes that whatever you are trying to prove did not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compute a statistic and then ask \"What is the chance of observing the test-statistic for this sample (considering its size and the probability governing the system), purely randomly (ie if the Null hypothesis were true)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This chance — the probability value of observing the test-statistic — is the so-called $p-$value. The $p-$value is the probability of getting a value of the test statistic at least as extreme as that\n",
    "actually observed value purely by chance, if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p < 0.05$: A $p$-value less than 0.05 for your result is considered by some scientists as statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis because what we're saying is that there less than a 5% probability the null is correct (and the results are random). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p > 0.05$: A $p$-value higher than 0.05 is not statistically significant and indicates strong evidence for the null hypothesis. In this case we would keep the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis. Note that we **cannot accept the null hypothesis**, we can only reject the null or fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a schematic showing this idea:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://github.com/haleygomez/Data-Analysis-2021/raw/master/blended_exercises/Chapter%204/pvalue.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So the kind of statistical statement you may read is something like the following, \"Feeding chocolate to female chickens gives a proportion of male chicks that is significantly less than 50% (with $p=0.001$).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**But beware:**\n",
    "- having a $p$-value below 0.05 does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the research hypothesis is true. \n",
    "- Stating a low $p$ value does not prove our research idea is correct because this would imply we have 100% certainty which is impossible.\n",
    "- we would instead comment that our results provide support for a research theory."

    "It is possible to make two types of error in classical hypothesis testing when you reject a null hypothesis, and they have well defined names:\n",

    " - Type I error is when you (for some reason) reject $H_0$ when it is true (eg experimental results deviate from this purely by chance) - this results in a false positive.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can assign a probability to our Type I error ie what is the significance level at which we reject the null hypothesis. We often choose a value of $\\alpha=0.05$ but it can be determined by the individual or team.   When a p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis. As an example, if a test gives the p-value, $p = 0.03$, the null hypothesis would be rejected at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, but not at the more conservative significance level $\\alpha = 0.01$.\n",

    "Often data analysts use a confidence interval of 95% to quote their numbers. A statement that you may see is ”Feeding chocolate to female chickens produced 36.1% male chicks with a 95% confidence interval of 25.9 to 47.4%.\"\n",

    "For example, your mean battery life might be 105 hours, and the 95% confidence interval in that number ranges from 100 to 110 hours. That means if you repeat your experiment millions of times, 95% of the time you repeat your experiment, the average battery life will fall into that range and the other 5% it will not.  Take a look at the figure below to see this illustrated (taken from [here](https://www.simplypsychology.org/confidence-interval.html)).\n",

    "What this is really telling us is that of the many 95% confidence intervals produced from multiple experiments in order to try and measure a variable, 95% are expected to contain the true value. The other 5% of experiments may completely fail!   This is a bit awkward! See the image below (taken from [here](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-uncertainty.html)) for an illustration of this for a confidence interval of 68% (ie for this variable, the confidence interval includes the true mean approximately 68% of the time - green).\n",

As such we can also quote a 95% confidence interval as $\\mbox{mean} \\pm 1.96\\sigma$, or a 99.7% confidence interval as $\\mbox{mean} \\pm 3\\sigma$.\n",

    "- The narrower the confidence interval (upper and lower values), the more precise is our estimate.\n",
    "- The confidence interval on your sample statistic should become more narrow as you make more measurements $N \\to \\infty$ as you approach your population value.\n",
