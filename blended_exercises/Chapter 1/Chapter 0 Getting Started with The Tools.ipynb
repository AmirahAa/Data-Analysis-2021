For instance, Gravitational-wave observations are shared with Jupyter notebooks, e.g. GW190814. Google, IBM, Microsoft use it regularly. It's a very good way to share computational ideas with rich documentation, and is in particular great for plotting. *"

Sometimes cells can try to remember variables or functions or datafiles that have been deleted. First you can try clearing the outputs using \"Edit -> Clear all outputs\". The best thing to do if things seem to be going wrong is to reset your environment:\n",
